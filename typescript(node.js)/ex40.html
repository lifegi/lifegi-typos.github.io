        /*Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
        The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object 
        containing these two pieces of information. Use  the  function  to  make  three  dictionaries 
        representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects  are  storing the 
        album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store
         the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks,
         add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number
          of tracks on an album.*/
        function Make_album(artist,album){
            this.artistname = artist;
            this.albumname = album;
        }
    var  make_album1 = new Make_album("Dua Lipa", "One Kiss");
    var  make_album2 = new Make_album("Billie Ellish", "Boring");
    var  make_album3 = new Make_album("Stan", "Eminem");
    console.log (make_album1)
    console.log (make_album2)
    console.log (make_album3)
